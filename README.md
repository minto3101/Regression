# Regression
Prediction of Burnt Calories using Regression Algorithms

The dataset I have used for this project is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos

I have cleaned the data to make it usable for a regression model
The data did not have any missing values, I changed catgeorical variables to numerical type.

The regression models used and their respective accuracies are: 

1)Linear Regression : 0.9668790377181355

2)Random Forest Regressor: 0.9981751286062136
